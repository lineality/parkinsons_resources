# Physical Exercise and Medication
Depending on a doctor's or other professional's view, exercise/activity/therapy is either as important as medication or is more important than medication (and specific cases likely vary). 

Over the years, the 'neuroplasticity of the brain,' or the ability of the brain to recover, has become somewhat better understood. For Parkinson's Disease, many (but not all) doctors and other professionals now see regular therapeutic activity as essential and mandatory for preventing symptoms, preventing worsening of symptoms, or recovering somewhat or completely from (eliminating existing) symptoms. 

# Categories of Exercise or Therapy
Dividing up activities is rather arbitrary, but a practical division into two areas (that follow two of the main bundled regimes of clinically tested sets of activities) may be: Physical & Speech

#### 1. Physical: 
PT, OT, LSVT-Big & "Rock-Steady" or Non-Contact Boxing
(PT stands for Physical Therapy, OT is "Occupational Therapy '', LSVT is a patented specific variant of therapeutic activities described more broadly here so as not to infringe on the copyright of super-secret-squirl stretching and reaching activities.) 
Rocksteady or Non-Contact boxing has become increasingly used and various videos and resources should be available online. 

#### 2. Speech: 
SLP or Speech Language and Cognition, e.g. Parkinson Voice Project

(SLP stands for "Speech Language Pathology" which if confusing is standard terminology

# Buddy & Checklist
- Keeping track of your activities and having a partner or buddy can help regular exercise and fitness. For some more than others, it may be advisably safer to have assistance, especially if falling presents any risk. And since a standard part of Parkinsons is needing to re-train the brain to understand where the body is and what it is doing (the actual body contracts and quiets while the brain thinks motions remain normal), having a buddy or trainer to give feedback can be vital.
