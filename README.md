Depending on a doctor's or other professional's view, exersize/activity/therapy is either as important as medication or is more important than medication (and specific cases likely vary). 

Dividing up activities is arbitrary, but a practical division of ~two areas may be:
1. PT, LSVT-Big & "Rock-Steady" or Non-Contact Boxing
2. SLP or Speach Language and Cognition, e.g. Parkinson Voice Project

(SLP stands for "Speach Language Pathology" which if confusing is standard terminology

The above is based on seven years of hands on experience as my father's primary cartaker.
