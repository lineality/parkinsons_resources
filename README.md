# Physical Exercise and Medication
Depending on a doctor's or other professional's view, exercise/activity/therapy is either as important as medication or is more important than medication (and specific cases likely vary). 

Over the years, the 'neuroplasticity of the brain,' or the ability of the brain to recover, has become somewhat better understood. For Parkinson's Disease, many (but not all) doctors and other professionals now see regular therapeutic activity as essential and mandatory for preventing symptoms, preventing worsening of symptoms, or recovering somewhat or completely from (eliminating existing) symptoms. 

# Categories of Exercise or Therapy
Dividing up activities is rather arbitrary, but a practical division into two areas (that follow two of the main bundled regimes of clinically tested sets of activities) may be: Physical & Speech

#### 1. Physical: 
PT, OT, LSVT-Big & "Rock-Steady" or Non-Contact Boxing
(PT stands for Physical Therapy, OT is "Occupational Therapy '', LSVT is a patented specific variant of therapeutic activities described more broadly here so as not to infringe on the copyright of super-secret-squirl stretching and reaching activities.) 
Rocksteady or Non-Contact boxing has become increasingly used and various videos and resources should be available online. 

#### 2. Speech: 
SLP or Speech Language and Cognition, e.g. Parkinson Voice Project

#### SLP
"SLP" stands for "Speech Language Pathology" which, if confusing, is standard terminology for a speech-swallowing therapist and/or a speech-language-brain-training therapist. 
An interesting distinction in the 'extend' vs. 'contract' goal of treating parkinsons, is that the LSVT-PT school focuses (it has been said, though I'm sure some will beg to differ) on increasing-the-amplitude: goal = bigger amplitude, 
whereas the SLP-SpeakOut school focuses on intent, or not being automatic: goal = act with intent / or act not-automatically. 
In some cases the semantics may be unhelpful when getting to the measurable-outcomes, but a core example from SpeakOut (perhaps the founding example) is that when people with parkinsons have trouble maintaining their ability to speak when counting from one to twenty (with the numbers fading to nothing by the end), when counting backwards (which for most people takes effort and deliberation and intent and cannot be done without thinking or focusing) each number can be said in a loud clear voice (by the same person who could not do that counting forwards). Retraining your brain to do things, perhaps with new neural pathways via neuroplasticity, using different parts of the brain is a key theme in parkinson's treatment, though the brain is still not well understood.

You may need to internalize a number of such examples and case studies to get a sense of a generalized (or not generalized) not-contraction (extension, amplitude, intent, focus etc.) to get a sense for how different doctors (who often focus on one area) may use their own narrow lexicon.

## 32x Routine
A note on the core 32x morning warmup routine that my father and I developed and that I now use daily as well. 
- Count on your fingers in binary from zero to thirty one (each hand can do this redundantly). For parkinsons, the more activities that you can stack and do simultaneously the better. Moving, counting on your fingers, and counting out loud, is a good example of stacking. If this presents a safety risk, do not try to do more than one thing at a time (e.g. talking and swallowing your food). But for exercise and physical therapy in a safe environment, you want to push and extend your ability to do multiple things.
- 32 times do the main step backwards (toe up on forward foot) with hand stretched back behind you.
- 32 times do the forward step and reach forwards
- 32 times do a side step and reach to the side (like a lopsided jumping jack), 
- 32 times reach step to the side and reach across (e.g. step with your right foot and reach to the right with your LEFT hand) 
#### 32 times do the standard non-contact-boxing motions of:
- "jab" (punch forward 1)
- "cross" (punch forward 1)
- hook (1)
- hook (2)
- uppercut (1)
- uppercut (2)
#### Note: The non-contact boxing may also help to balance your back and reduce back pain.  

# Buddy & Checklist
- Keeping track of your activities and having a partner or buddy can help regular exercise and fitness. For some more than others, it may be advisably safer to have assistance, especially if falling presents any risk. And since a standard part of Parkinsons is needing to re-train the brain to understand where the body is and what it is doing (the actual body contracts and quiets while the brain thinks motions remain normal), having a buddy or trainer to give feedback can be vital. 

#### The above is based on seven years of hands-on experience as my father's primary caretaker, gradually finding and tips and tools from many therapists.
