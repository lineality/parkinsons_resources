# Physical Exercise and Medication
Depending on a doctor's or other professional's view, exercise/activity/therapy is either as important as medication or is more important than medication (and specific cases likely vary). 

# Categories of Exercise or Therapy
Dividing up activities is arbitrary, but a practical division of ~two areas may be:
1. PT, LSVT-Big & "Rock-Steady" or Non-Contact Boxing
2. SLP or Speech Language and Cognition, e.g. Parkinson Voice Project

(SLP stands for "Speech Language Pathology" which if confusing is standard terminology
